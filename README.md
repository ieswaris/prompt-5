operators and managers?” Generated Context:
• The user interface should be intuitive and provide real-time data on machine 
performance, energy usage, and alerts.
• The system should convey reliability and ease of use, with minimal training 
required for operators.

## Exploratory Prompts:

• Prompt: “What are the technical requirements and environmental constraints for 
implementing automation in the factory setting?” Insights:
• The system must integrate with existing manufacturing equipment and 
communication protocols like Modbus or OPC UA.
• Environmental conditions such as dust, heat, and vibration in the factory should be 
considered when selecting sensors and controllers.
• The IoT devices should be rugged and reliable, capable of continuous operation in 
industrial settings.

• Test Prompt: “A machine is exhibiting unusual vibrations. How should the system detect 
and respond to this issue?” Outcome: The embedded sensors detect the anomaly in 
vibration patterns, and the system triggers a predictive maintenance alert, recommending 
an inspection before the equipment fails. The system reduces downtime and maintenance 
costs.

## Scenario 2: Energy Efficiency Optimization

• Test Prompt: “A production line is running during low demand hours. How should the 
system optimize energy usage?” Outcome: The system analyzes real-time production data 
and automatically reduces the operational speed or shuts down non-critical machines, 
significantly cutting down energy consumption.
4. Error Handling Prompts:
Scenario: Communication Failure between IoT Devices
• Prompt: “What happens if there’s a communication breakdown between the sensors and 
the central control unit?” Error Handling Plan: o The system will have redundant 
communication protocols to switch to an alternative network if one fails.

• Controllers: ARM-based microcontrollers for real-time control.
• Network: A robust wired or wireless communication network (e.g., LoRaWAN, 
Wi-Fi) for IoT connectivity.
• Cloud Integration: A cloud platform to store and analyze production data.

## 3. Testing and Deployment:
system will be tested in phases: first in a small section of the factory, then scaled to cover 
the entire production line. After testing, it will be deployed with continuous monitoring to 
ensure stability and performance.

## 6. Evaluation and Feedback Collection:

## Targeted Feedback Prompts:

• Prompt: “How has the automation system improved your production workflow? Are there 
any issues in terms of usability or performance?” User Feedback Summary: o Operators 
found the system easy to use and reported a 25% reduction in machine downtime. o
